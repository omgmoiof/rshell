# rshell

rshell is a program that functions like the Unix terminal but with limitations. The rshell program is able to excute simple commands such as: `ls, pwd, mkdir, rm,` and `echo`. 

rshell has a command prompt that looks like: `$`

rshell is able to execute commands with connectors such as: `&&, ||,` and`;`

It can also execute with commands with comments buy using the `#`

To exit rshell, type `exit` into the command line

We designed rshell by creating a UML diagram:

We ended up not using everything on the UML diagram. We did not use double command and comment. We renamed execute to main.
